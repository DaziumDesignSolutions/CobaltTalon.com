#Overview

Cobalt Talon LLC, head-quartered in Kansas City Missouri, was formed in May of 2011.  The company was founded for the purpose of creating and selling a high-performance analytic solution to companies in the healthcare marketplace.

Cobalt Talonâ€™s solution initially focused on meeting the needs of two key stakeholders, health plans and healthcare provider organizations, who demand easy and affordable access to business intelligence and related professional services.  These services are necessary for applying the newly found operational insights and strategies that will help drive success as the healthcare industry transforms.  Other target markets have emerged recently, including companies offering health and wellness solutions, insurance broker agencies, pharmaceutical clinical trial vendors, large self-insured employers and coalitions that represent them, provider networks, and consulting firms with the need to add an analytic platform to their own service offering.   

Critical success factors to gaining full advantage of any new system include ease-of-use that promotes end-user adoption, system to business value mapping, and an ongoing enhancements process required to keep pace with an ever-changing healthcare market.  Cobalt Talon addresses these factors by offering a full range of analytic products and support services to ensure customers gain optimal value. Customers access the solution via an online portal as a service, without software or hardware acquisition or installation.  Cobalt Talon also provides consulting and implementation services, training, technical support, and other extended services based on customer need.
