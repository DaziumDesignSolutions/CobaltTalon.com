###Assessment and Recommendations
Cobalt Talon  engagements are short, specific, directed engagements designed to provide high level documentation of and recommendations for one or more specific targeted areas. While the specific areas for assessment and recommendations can be tailored to an individual customer’s needs, the following are the most common type of assessments and can be done in combination:

* __Best Practices/Benchmarking__ – Cobalt Talon will compare the customer’s current solution to industry best practices in relevant areas including technology, process, organization, etc., and make recommendations on areas to improve as well as where industry best practices are not relevant and investments are not needed.
* __Business Status Assessment__ – This assessment captures the current processes and outputs, identifies “pain points,” understands data sources and content, and determines the impact a BI program does, will, or should have on an organization from a resources, technical, and process perspective, i.e., it defines how the business needs are or are not being met, and changes that need to occur to meet them.
* __Opportunity Assessment__ – Cobalt Talon will work with business leaders to identify where improved BI and analytics would help them achieve their goals. These opportunities could drive new initiatives, or help existing programs provide additional value with minimal investments.
* __Solution Alternatives__ – If business needs or opportunities have been identified, this effort identifies a range of solutions to satisfy the requirements, and makes recommendations around which solutions provide the most value compared to the current and expected business needs.
