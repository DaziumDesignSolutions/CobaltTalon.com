While Cobalt Talon’s expertise, capabilities and ability to staff are fairly broad, we primarily focus on several key offerings. 

###Assessment and Recommendations
`KARA MAKE THIS A DROP DOWN -Assessment and Recommendation (Assessment) engagements are short, specific, targeted engagements designed to provide high level documentation of and recommendations for one or more specific targeted areas. While the specific areas for assessment and recommendations can be tailored to an individual customer’s needs, the following are the most common type of assessments and can be done together in combination:

• Best Practices/Benchmarking – CT will compare the customer’s current solution to industry best practices in relevant areas including, technology, process, organization, etc., and make recommendations on areas to improve as well as where industry best practices are not relevant and investments are not needed.

• Business Status Assessment – This assessment captures the current processes and outputs, identifies “pain points”, understands data sources and content, and determines the impact a BI program does, will, or should have on an organization from a resources, technical, and process perspective, i.e., it defines how the business needs are or are not being met, and changes that need to occur to meet them.

• Opportunity Assessment – CT will work with business leaders to identify where improved BI and analytics would help them achieve their goals. These opportunities could drive new initiatives, or help existing programs provide additional value with minimal investments.

• Solution Alternatives – If business needs or opportunities have been identified, this effort identifies a range of solutions to satisfy the requirements, and makes recommendations around which solutions provide the most value compared to the current and expected business needs.`

###Strategy and Roadmap
`KARA MAKE THIS A DROP DOWN - Strategy and Roadmap engagements are designed to provide the customer an actionable plan to achieve their goals in a cost efficient manner. The strategy development effort is a planning initiative that defines the collective vision. CT analyzes the business, operational, and technical opportunities and develops them into a single, comprehensive, multi-phased implementation plan. The process produces tangible recommendations for the functional, data, technical, and organizational components of the solution.`
