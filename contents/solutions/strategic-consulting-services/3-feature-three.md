Enterprise Information Management Delivers Major Business Benefits For Health Insurance Provider

Knightsbridge Solution Enables Business Transformation
The client is a leading provider of specialized insurance products and services with annual revenue of $7 billion. Recognizing that its market was evolving rapidly, the company identified several strategic business initiatives to reinforce its leadership position. These initiatives leverage information resources to drive major enhancements in some of the company’s core business processes, including underwriting, customer segmentation, and customer placement. The company partnered with Knightsbridge Solutions to define a data strategy and build an information architecture to support these strategic objectives.

Business and Technology Challenge
The client realized that information was the key to improving their business functions. Decision makers needed consistent and reliable information, sourced from multiple systems, in order to understand and enhance processes. However, the client’s data infrastructure and reporting tools were incapable of delivering consistent and reliable enterprise information. The existing data store was inflexible and incapable of scaling to meet demand. Further, the company recently merged with another organization, which created substantial systems integration and standardization difficulties. The business required integrated enterprise data and flexible, user-driven information access.

Solution
The company engaged with Knightsbridge to develop an information management solution. In phase one of the engagement, the team delivered end-to-end data capabilities, incorporating data modeling, extract, transform, and load (ETL) architecture, metadata definition, and data governance. The process began with a large-scale data modeling exercise to optimize the solution for access and scalability. The data model provides standardization of definitions across business units and functional areas. Building on this model, the team developed an ETL architecture that integrates current and historical data across seven distinct business subject areas. The information architecture incorporates data quality and governance methodologies and compliance reporting requirements.
Phase two focused on the underwriting data mart, including the definition of requirements, business rules, and key performance measures. Knightsbridge evaluated the availability of source data for the defined measures and identified gaps. As part of the data mart implementation, the team also performed data profiles on all available source data to identify in advance any issues with data quality. In addition to the Phase one and two implementation work, the team re-engineered approximately 10 legacy data marts to source data from the new enterprise data warehouse. In many cases, the re-engineering work leveraged the Knightsbridge Development Center, a facility that provides skilled data warehousing professionals through an offsite engagement model. The Development Center provided design, implementation, and quality assurance testing services with greater resource flexibility and reduced project costs. 

Throughout the engagement, Knightsbridge utilized our project value accelerators, including the Audit, Balance, and Control (ABC) data quality solution and the Codes and Data Mapping Application (CDMA) for metadata management. These pre-built value accelerators enable healthcare organizations to benefit from Knightsbridge’s expertise in the industry, decrease time-to-value, and reduce risk.

Results
Knightsbridge delivered an enterprise data warehouse solution that provides a stable and scalable information architecture. The solution integrates the complex systems environment into a single version of the truth and enables the client to leverage its information resources to drive strategic business initiatives.

With the enterprise information solution in place, the client is transforming its core business processes and generated quantifiable benefits:

•	Revised underwriting guidelines: Improved load assessment and risk stratification capabilities enable the client to evaluate loss experience and rewrite its underwriting guidelines. The estimated business value of the revised underwriting processes is more than $100 million.
•	Improved customer segmentation: The client will use analytics to enhance its customer and agent segmentation and refine its value proposition for targeted customers. The client expects this change in market strategy to drive increases in sales effectiveness worth an estimated $120 million.
•	New placement strategies: Enterprise information will enable the client to evaluate customer placement strategies and adjust premiums, coverage, and deductibles. Improvements in placement power and customer retention are expected to have a business value of more than $40 million.
•	Offer optimization: The client will develop models to match offers with customer types, driving increased acceptance rates and reduced offer cycles.
•	Underwriting automation: Automating the underwriting process decreases application turnaround time, improves compliance, and enables point-of-sale underwriting.
•	Prescription history: Analyzing and understanding customer prescription histories improves risk management
