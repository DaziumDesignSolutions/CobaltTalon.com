### Normative Data

We leverage one of the healthcare industryâ€™s largest normative databases, which includes contributors such as national payers, large employers and CMS. The empirical database contains more than 30 million lives and 2 billion records of medical claims, pharmaceutical claims, and eligibility information. The benchmark comparisons include points from loosely managed care to well-managed care.
