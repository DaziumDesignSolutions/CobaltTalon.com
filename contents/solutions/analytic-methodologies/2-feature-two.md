### Risk Adjustment

We utilize a sophisticated suite of risk adjustment tools with a variety of predictive modeling applications for the health insurance industry. There are two broad categories of models: concurrent models and prospective models. The models calculate a risk score based on medical claims data (e.g. diagnosis & procedure codes) and pharmacy claims data, if available.
